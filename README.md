Name of Virtual World: The Park 
‘Hey you! Yeah you! Do something for the local community for once and clean up the park, explore and find all the bit of rubbish and throw it into the bin!’
An Interactive City Park for you to clean up! Go and explore this park and see if you can find all 5 recyclable bits of litter let on the ground.
The concept for this world is to get a soul used to the experience of using VR with an objective for the user to focus on. The premise is for the user to search the ‘local’ park find and pick up interactive metal cans and then throw them in the Bin. This task gets the user to explore the world with a dedicated task hopefully resulting in less motion sickness and an easier transition in to using VR.

Explanation of the purpose of additional feature 1:
The First Feature I decided to include was interactable objects as I wanted the experience of every soul that used the world to have a different experience than the rest. As I was designing a park having metal Cans ‘left’ around the park gave the user a task to complete while in the virtual world. Picking up these cans could be the first time someone has used an interactable in VR so having an easy task of picking up and dropping or throwing them into the bin would be quite rewarding. As you can throw from anywhere in the map and because of the accelerometers in the controllers how much power you put into a throw portrays the same in the virtual world meaning you can create games such as a basketball game with friends and see who can get the can in the bin from the furthest. 

Explanation of the purpose of additional feature 2:
I added a Settings menu which allows the user to change their experience to their tastes.
One of the settings in the menu is a music volume slider, I included music as I wanted the user to get immersive with The Park and the more senses the virtual world included, the higher user’s feeling of immersion (Yokokohji, 2000). Studies have also shown that the sense of hearing is the second most import part of feeling immersive after sight (Heilig, 1992). The scroller is there so that the user can reduce, increase or remove the volume completely. 
I also added a dropdown selection for which turning method the user wanted to experience. I prefer continuous as it feels more natural to me however, I know others might disagree, as there are many public discussions on places such as reddit where people discuss the matter. So, I wanted each user to be able to select want is best for them.

 
Reflection of my Virtual World:
I think the virtual world works well on from idea of my concept, I think the additional features add to the experience and I think it is at a relative complete state. As with any design project, there is still improvements to make and features I wish to add in, and I had to remove due to my lack of knowledge and tight timings at this early to fix little issues that were arising. 

Mindset:
Happy, had a couple of high stress moments as I was learning a new program (Unity) that I haven’t touched before and coming across a few issues stopping me from achieving what I wanted due to my lack of experience in the program. However, a lot of the issue I did manage to cover come and mostly fulfil what I set out to do.
